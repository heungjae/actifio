### Installing Actifio Global Manager (AGM)

Actifio Global Manager (AGM) provides centralized management capabilities in a virtual appliance that can be deployed on standard VMware ESX servers. From one centralized AGM management system, you use the AGM web-based UI to manage multiple Actifio CDS and Actifio Sky appliances and perform various day-to-day copy data operations. Actifio appliances are the highly scalable copy data platforms that virtualize application data to improve the resiliency, agility, and cloud mobility of your business.
